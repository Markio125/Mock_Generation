      "content": "In the bustling city of Mumbai, a medium-sized textile manufacturing company, \"Trendy Fabrics,\" exports cotton textiles to various countries, including the United States and the UK. The company has relied heavily on a stable exchange rate to maintain their profit margins on exports. Recently, the Indian rupee has depreciated significantly against the US dollar and the British pound due to increased demand for foreign goods and services, coupled with a rise in interest rates abroad. As a result, the exchange rate shifted from Rs. 50 to Rs. 70 per dollar.\n\nThis depreciation had mixed effects on Trendy Fabrics. On one hand, their export revenues increased in rupee terms, as they received more rupees for each dollar earned. On the other hand, the cost of imported raw materials surged, leading to higher production costs. The company had to navigate these changes while contemplating whether to increase their prices or absorb the costs to maintain their market share.\n\nThe management of Trendy Fabrics is now analyzing their balance of payments, specifically the current account balance, which includes the trade balance of their cotton exports against the imported materials. They are also considering government policies that might intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the rupee.\n\nAs Trendy Fabrics strategizes on how to adapt to these economic shifts, they are keenly aware that fluctuations in the exchange rate can significantly impact their profitability, investment decisions, and overall market competitiveness.",

      "title": "** Market Equilibrium in the Wheat Industry**",
      "content": "In the bustling town of Agriville, wheat is the primary agricultural product, and the market for this essential commodity has recently seen fluctuations due to varying consumer demand and government interventions. The equilibrium price of wheat was established at Rs. 40 per kg, with an equilibrium quantity of 160 kg. However, a spike in consumer demand due to a local festival led to an increase in the demand for wheat, shifting the demand curve rightward. As a result, the demand now exceeds the supply, creating excess demand in the market.\n\nRecognizing the potential for rising prices, the government intervened by imposing a price ceiling of Rs. 30 per kg to ensure that wheat remains affordable for low-income families. This price ceiling, while well-intentioned, led to a significant shortage of wheat, as the quantity demanded surged to 175 kg, while farmers were only willing to supply 145 kg at that price. As consumers struggled to find wheat, long queues formed outside ration shops, and some began to engage in black market transactions, paying higher prices to secure their needed supplies. \n\nThe situation in Agriville illustrates the complexities of market equilibrium, where government interventions can lead to unintended consequences such as shortages and the emergence of black markets, ultimately disrupting the initial equilibrium of the wheat market.\n\n**",

It resulted in a surplus of wheat.  \n   **Answer: C**  \n   **Explanation:** The price ceiling of Rs. 30 resulted in excess demand, as the quantity demanded increased to 175 kg while the supply decreased to 145 kg.\n\n3. What was the quantity supplied of wheat when the price ceiling was imposed?\n   A. 175 kg\n   B. 160 kg\n   C. 145 kg\n   D. 200 kg  \n   **Answer: C**  \n   **Explanation:** At the price ceiling of Rs. 30, the farmers were only willing to supply 145 kg of wheat, indicating a shortage.\n\n4.
