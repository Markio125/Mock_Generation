macroeconomics usually simplify analysis country’s total production level employment related attributes (called ‘variables’) like prices rate interest wage rates profits focusing single imaginary

commodity less also happens others particularly attributes start changing fast like prices going (in called inflation) employment production levels going (heading depression) general directions

‘small’) agents – consumers choosing respective optimum combinations goods buy given tastes incomes producers trying make maximum profit producing goods keeping costs low possible selling price high could get markets words microeconomics study individual markets demand supply ‘players’ decisionmakers also individuals (buyers sellers even companies) seen trying maximise profits (as producers sellers) personal satisfaction welfare levels (as consumers) even large company ‘micro’ sense act interest shareholders necessarily interest country whole microeconomics ‘macro’ (meaning ‘large’) phenomena affecting economy whole like inflation unemployment either mentioned taken given variables individual buyers sellers could change nearest microeconomics got macroeconomics looked general
